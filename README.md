# Minesweeper

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital entertainment, classic games hold a special place, serving as timeless reminders of the simplicity and elegance of gameplay that transcends generations. Among these classics, Minesweeper stands as a beacon of strategy and deduction, captivating players with its blend of logic, chance, and skill. Originating in the nascent days of computer gaming, Minesweeper quickly rose to prominence, becoming a staple of early Windows operating systems and captivating audiences worldwide.


## Getting Started

In this project, we developed a classic Minesweeper game using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language. Minesweeper is a grid-based logic puzzle game where players aim to uncover all non-mine squares without triggering any mines. The game provides clues in the form of numbers that indicate how many mines are adjacent to the uncovered square. The objective is to clear the entire grid as quickly as possible without hitting a mine. Our implementation includes multiple difficulty levels and provides a smooth, engaging user experience across both Android and iOS platforms. This project highlights the use of Flutter in creating visually appealing and functionally robust mobile applications.
